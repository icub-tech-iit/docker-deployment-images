#The EXPOSE instruction does not actually publish the port. 
#It functions as a type of documentation between the person who builds the image and the person who runs the container, about which ports are intended to be published. 
#To actually publish the port when running the container, use the -p flag on docker run to publish and map one or more ports, or the -P flag to publish all exposed ports and map them to high-order ports.
